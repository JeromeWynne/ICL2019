Faraway's comments on diagnostics (Chapter 4 of Linear Models for R):
  > Classifies problems according to three categories:
      - Error (assumption regarding error distn)
      - Model (assumption regarding mean function)
      - Unusual observations (assumptions regarding outliers)
      
  1. Checking error assumptions:
    - We know the distribution of the residual under the model.
    - Diagnostics are commonly run on residuals as though they were the error. This is because the effect of the hat matrix is small.
    - We assume that the distribution of the residual (conditional on
      X and y) is N(0, sigma^2(I - H)). The mean and variance are
      not functions of y and, if H is negligible such that the
      residual distribution is well-approximated by the error 
      distribution, will not be functions of X either.
      If we assume that e ~ eps and EY ~ X hat(b), then we can
      check that the error distribution does not vary with Xhat(b).
      If it does, then there is evidence that the model's assumptions
      are violated. 
      Likewise, we would need to check that the distribution of the
      residuals does not depend on the covariate values. This
      can be checked by plotting the residual against each covariate
